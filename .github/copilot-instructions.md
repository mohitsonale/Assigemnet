# Copilot Instructions for AI Coding Agents

## Project Overview
This project currently contains a single file: `index.html`, which is empty. There are no other source files, configuration files, or documentation present in the workspace.

## Immediate Guidance for AI Agents
- **Project Type:** This is a blank HTML project. There is no build system, test framework, or external dependencies configured.
- **Starting Point:** All new code should be added to `index.html` or new files as required. If implementing a web page, follow standard HTML5 structure and best practices.
- **No Existing Conventions:** There are no project-specific coding conventions, workflows, or architectural patterns to follow at this time.
- **No Integration Points:** The project does not currently integrate with any external services, APIs, or libraries.
- **No Documentation:** There is no README or other documentation. If adding new features, consider documenting them in a new `README.md` at the project root.

## Example Workflow
1. To add a basic web page, start by creating a valid HTML5 template in `index.html`.
2. For additional functionality (CSS, JS), create and link new files as needed.
3. If the project expands, update this file to reflect new conventions, workflows, or architectural decisions.

## Key Files
- `index.html`: Main entry point for the project. Currently empty.

**Note:** Update this file as the project grows to help future AI agents understand new patterns, workflows, and conventions.
